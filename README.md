Factorial Algorithm - Exploring TDD with Mocha

1. Installed and setup Mocha as a dependency

2. Built a test file, following TDD protocol, wrote test for failure > wrote implementation code > refactored implementation code > wrote new tests.

3. Implementation code works as intended with various test cases (E.G 3! is equal to 6).

4. Ran several tests and confirmed the algorithm works as intended.
